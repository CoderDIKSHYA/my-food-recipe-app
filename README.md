### ✅ Next Steps:

1. Save the above content in a file called `README.md` in the root of your GitHub project.
2. If you're hosting frontend/backend separately (e.g., Render, Vercel), I can also help with the deployed links and instructions.
3. Want dark-mode demo screenshots or GIFs? I can generate styled demo images too.

Let me know if you want:
- A **deployment guide**
- **Screenshot section filled**
- A **video preview link**
- or **badges** (for stars, forks, tech stack)

Just say the word!
